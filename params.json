{"name":"Finishingtool","tagline":"finshingTool ","body":"FinisherSC\r\n=============\r\nIf you encounter any issue, please feel free to directly contact me at kklam@eecs.berkeley.edu\r\nMy name is  Ka-Kit Lam. \r\n\r\nOur paper is located at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/03/010215\r\n\r\n## Command to run the tool ##\r\n\r\nHere is the command to run the tool:\r\n\r\n\tpython finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath\r\n\t\r\nIf you are running on server computer and would like to use multiple threads, then the following commands can generate 20 threads to run FinisherSC. \r\n\r\n\tpython finisherSC.py -par 20 destinedFolder mummerPath\r\n\r\n## Input and output files ##\r\n\r\nNote that it is assumed that you have \"contigs.fasta\" , \"raw_reads.fasta\" in the destinedFolder and mummerPath is your path to Mummer. Therefore, please rename the files in the destinedFolder if needed. For \"finisherSC.py\", the key output file is **improved3.fasta** in destinedFolder. \r\n\r\n\r\n## A sample test run ##\r\nHere is an example run with the pre-installed data files and softwares(e.g. Mummer, Gepard) [Please go to https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xjpt8xf5g1xf0ek/bGmZvt9Zfd to Download the EColi-Data set as test cases coz it is too big for GitHub].\r\n\r\n1. You may run the test cases as python finisherSC.py EcoliTestRun/ MUMmer3.23/\r\n2. After the processing, take the file whose name is **improved3.fasta** in destinedFolder and this is your output file.\r\n3. If you want to visualize the output against the reference, you can use software like Gepard.\r\n\r\n## Options[Supplementary usage] ##\r\na)Fast mode (e.g. for large and complex genomes , you may want to use this mode to get results faster; However, there will be a bit of computation vs quality trade-off if you want to use this mode; We suggest that you use this mode only when you got stuck in the standard mode): \r\n\r\n\tpython finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath -f True \r\n[It means that you want to use the fast mode ]\r\n\r\nb)Pick from previous jobs (e.g. you have got improved2.fasta but the cluster node timeout and you want to start from improved2.fasta instead of from scratch)\r\n\r\n\tpython finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath  -p improved2.fasta\r\n\r\nc)Mapping between old contigs and new contigs(e.g. you want to know how the contigs from contigs.fasta are mapped to improved3.fasta )\r\n\r\n\tpython finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath -o contigs.fasta_improved3.fasta\r\n[It will then output the alignment of improved3.fasta against contigs.fasta. The output will be shown in the terminal and in mappingResults.txt at the destinedFolder]\r\n\r\nd)There is an experimental improvement based on repeat phasing and the further improved file is improved4.fasta. An illustration of that part is given in Fig. 7 of http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6971 . To experiment with that, first run finisherSC.py as before. After that, you can issue the following command:\r\n\r\n\tpython experimental/xPhaser.py destinedFolder mummerPath\r\n\r\ne) There is also an experimental improvement resolving tandem repeat. The further improved file is tademResolved.fasta. To experiment with that, first run finisherSC.py as before. After that, you can issue the following command:\r\n\r\n\tpython experimental/tSolver.py destinedFolder mummerPath\r\n\r\n\r\nf)Help. You can always use -h to get the usage suggestion. \r\n\r\n\tpython finisherSC.py -h\r\n\r\ng)Parallel mode. You can now use -par 20 to run finisherSC on 20 threads. The command is \r\n        \r\n\tpython finisherSC.py -par 20 destinedFolder mummerPath\r\n\r\n## Data files for experiments ##\r\nWe are using the benchmark datasets available online in PacBio DevNet. And we can run FinisherSC to process those data to completion. For (1, 2, 3), we use -par 20 option and run it on a server computer and we get them finished in a couple of hours to a day. For (4), we run without any options on a laptop and get it finished in a couple of minutes. \r\n  \r\n1.

After passing through the finishingTool, it is advised to use a polishing tool(e.g. Quiver) to polish the improved contigs( i.e. improved3.fasta )\r\n2. If you have problem running scipy.weave, try to remove ~/.python27_compiled \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-52516611-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
